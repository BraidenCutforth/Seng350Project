## User stories

These are the user stories we have implemented.

#### As a user, I want to create an account and sign in.

We want users to create an account and sign in before posting reviews or trying to edit their profile. This helps us keep track of who is posting what reviews, in case of spammers.  

We have overhauled our auth since the last milestone and use cookies to verify whether the user has signed in or not. If the user has not signed in, they will not be able to post a review or edit their profile.


#### As a user I want to search for a destination and view the results.

The main feature of our application are the destination reviews. We want to make searching for reviews as quick and easy as possible. The landing page of our app shows a search bar, prompting the user to input a search query right away.

Once the user inputs a query, the page calls the search function within both the country and destination model and combines the results. This means that the results will return both countries and destinations. If the search string is empty, all possible results will appear. If there is no match, a prompt will appear for the user to try something else.


#### As a user I want to create, read, update, and delete a review so I can perform the essential actions of the application.

A review for a destination can be created from the destination page. After the user successfully searches for their destination, the destination page shows the reviews corresponding to their destination and a button that lets the user create a review.

The create review page lets the user write their review in markdown and view a live preview.

Reivews on the destination page can also be edited or deleted. These are buttons at the top of the review page.


#### As a user I want to be able to customize my profile in order to increase my UX and attract other users to my page.

You are only able to edit your own profile page. If you attempt to edit a profile page that isn't yours, you will not be allowed to. As well, the edit profile button should not appear on profile pages which are not your own.

You should be able to edit your profile picture, although this currently isn't implemented. Rigth now, we have public URLs which are used as strings in the database to retrieve your profile picture. 

You are also able to update details in your proile such as a bio, location, email, and names.

#### As a user I want to be able to view all reviews authored by another user so I can view where they have been.

If you like a specific reviewer's writing style of their content in general, and want to view more of their content, you can do so on their profile page. The profile page renders the review data contained within the profile data and displays all reviews authored by the user.

#### As an admin I want to be able to manage users so I can perform admin-related actions such as deleting/suspending accounts, etc.

We have given certain users admin privileges and rights. The admin console can be accessed from a button on the user's profile page. The admin console shows the information of all current users within the application.

The table renders all the users in the database and shows information such as username, email, first and last name, whether or not they are an admin, and a delete button.  


#### As an admin I want to be able to delete user reviews so I can censor any content that violates the terms and conditions.

Through the admin console, the admin can delete users. This power is reserved for admins in case we get users who write spam or unrelated content.

This is done by sending a request through the controller, which fetches the username of the user being deleted, and deletes the user from the database.

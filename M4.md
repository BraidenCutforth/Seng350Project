## User stories

These are the user stories we have implemented.

#### As a user, I want to create an account and sign in.

#### As a user I want to search for a destination and view the results.

#### As a user I want to create, read, update, and delete a review so I can perform the essentials actions of the application.

#### As a user I want to be able to customize my profile in order to increase my UX and attract other users to my page.

#### As a user I want to be able to view all reviews authored by another user so I can view where they have been.

#### As an admin I want to be able to manage users so I can perform admin-related actions such as deleting/suspending accounts, etc.

#### As an admin I want to be able to delete user reviews so I can censor any content that violates the terms and agreement.
